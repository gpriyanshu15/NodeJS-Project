# User Management API

This project is a simple Express.js application providing RESTful APIs for managing users. It includes routes for retrieving, updating, deleting, and creating users. The user data is now stored in a MongoDB database, replacing the previous JSON file storage.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running locally.
5. Start the server by running `node index.js`. The server will start on port 8000.

## Routes

- **GET /users**: Returns an HTML list of all users' first names.
- **GET /api/users**: Returns a JSON array of all users.
- **GET /api/users/:id**: Returns the user with the specified ID.
- **PATCH /api/users/:id**: Updates the user with the specified ID.
- **DELETE /api/users/:id**: Deletes the user with the specified ID.
- **POST /api/users**: Creates a new user.

## Usage

### Retrieving Users

- To retrieve all users, send a GET request to `/api/users`.
- To retrieve a specific user, send a GET request to `/api/users/:id`, replacing `:id` with the user's ID.

### Updating Users

- To update a user's information, send a PATCH request to `/api/users/:id` with the updated data in the request body.

### Deleting Users

- To delete a user, send a DELETE request to `/api/users/:id`, replacing `:id` with the ID of the user to be deleted.

### Creating Users

- To create a new user, send a POST request to `/api/users` with the user's information in the request body.

## Data Format

The user data is stored in a MongoDB database. Each user object has the following properties:

- **\_id**: The unique identifier for the user generated by MongoDB.
- **first_name**: The user's first name.
- **last_name**: The user's last name.
- **email**: The user's email address.
- **gender**: The user's gender.
- **ip_address**: The user's IP address.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- **express**: For building the RESTful API.
- **mongoose**: For modeling MongoDB data.
- **body-parser**: For parsing request bodies.
- **dotenv**: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
- **cors**: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## MVC Architecture

The project has been updated to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern:

- **Model**: Defines the schema and interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- **View**: Responsible for rendering HTML responses (only used for `/users` route).
- **Controller**: Contains the route handlers and business logic for user management operations.
